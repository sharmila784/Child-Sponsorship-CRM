Child Sponsorship CRM Project

Stage 1: Understanding the Problem & Sector Insights
Objective: Build clarity on the purpose of the system and the value it delivers.

1. Collecting Requirements

Engage with different stakeholders (program directors, donor management staff, field officers, child welfare teams).

Sample Needs:

-> Maintain a record of all sponsored children (personal details, school info, health status).
-> Record sponsor details and track donation history.
-> Link sponsors with one or more children.
-> Provide progress updates and generate impact stories.
-> Track recurring contributions and send reminders.
-> Automate thank-you emails and acknowledgments.

2. Identifying Key Users

-> System Administrator → Configures Salesforce, manages permissions.
-> Program Coordinator → Oversees sponsorship program, monitors progress.
-> Donor Relations Staff → Handles sponsor accounts, contributions, and communication.
-> Field Volunteers → Update child status (education, medical, activities).
-> Sponsors → External donors receiving updates through automated emails or reports.

3. Mapping the Sponsorship Process

Typical Flow:
Sponsor commits a donation → Child assigned to sponsor → Field updates added → Sponsor receives periodic updates/reports → Renewal/reminder cycle initiated.

4. Sector-specific Considerations

In child-focused nonprofits:

-> Accountability is crucial → Donors expect clarity on fund usage.
-> Engagement drives retention → Regular communication keeps sponsors involved.
-> Sensitive data → Child details must be protected.
-> Outcome-focused reporting → Organizations must showcase impact (schooling, healthcare, overall development).

Therefore, the CRM solution must:

-> Manage sponsor–child linkages efficiently.
-> Streamline periodic updates and communication.
-> Support recurring donation workflows.
-> Ensure compliance with data protection standards.

5. Exploring Existing Solutions

On Salesforce AppExchange, tools like Nonprofit Success Pack (NPSP) already support donor and program management.
These are feature-rich, but for learning purposes, we’ll design a lean, customized system focused only on child sponsorship to practice Salesforce customization.
